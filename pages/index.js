          Hello! My name is Jakub Kropáček and I&apos;m from Czech Republic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been interested in programming since my primary school, after I
          saw a Scratch icon on my desktop in computer science class. That
          didn&apos;t last long, after few days I found out about JavaScript on
          Youtube. And that is why I chose the path I&apos;m going on right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose Technical School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
          Science as my secondary school (which I&apos;m still studying by now)
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m mostly interested in Networking Technologies and
          Cybersecurity but that is only a plan for a university in my future.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I do right now is programming mostly for fun or trying to
          contribute on Open Source projects. I love learning and trying new
          technologies
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some languages I have tried and been able to do something
          with them:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Go (Least knowledge)</li>
            <li>PHP (Little more knowledge than Go)</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS (I don&apos;t like CSS tho)</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Other skills and knowledge:
          <ul>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Next.js</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>Arduino</li>
            <li>Cisco IOS (Still learning)</li>
            <li>Linux (Still learning)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
